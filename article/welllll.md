## Introduction
Conway's Game of Life^[1], conceived by mathematician John Conway in 1970, is a cellular automaton operating on a grid of cells. Governed by four simple rules, each cell's status is determined by its neighboring cells, leading to a rich tapestry of patterns ranging from static formations to dynamic entities. Beyond its recreational appeal, the Game of Life finds application in scientific domains such as computer science, mathematics, and biology. Its enduring significance lies in its ability to stimulate inquiry into emergent complexity in various systems. In this article we will explore the evolution of a
